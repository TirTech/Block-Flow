    This is an in-depth explanation of how to use BlockFlow!

    BlockFlow is a flowchart design that works by stacking multiple 'Blocks' on top of each other. Each Block is represented with a unique color and functionality. Blocks run themselves, then all of the Blocks in them from top to bottom (left to right if there are any Blocks on the same line.

#Blocks
    This section is dedicated to the explanation of each individual block type. Blocks can be added by dragging them off of the 'Block' menu presented on the left hand side of the window.
    Assignment Block - This block is responsible for assigning variables that have been created in the <variable creation window> with a value.
    If Block - This block is responsible for decision making. It is made up of two parts, If and Else. It can be given one or two variables, and compare those variables to a value or each other in the 'If' section. If the comparison is true, the 'If' section will be run. If the comparison is false, the 'Else' section will be run.
    For Block - This block is responsible for doing an action multiple times. It has a condition like an If Block and will run itself until that condition is false.
