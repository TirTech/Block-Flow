# CS3035GroupProject
Group project for CS3035 Building User Interfaces
## Requirements
  In this project you will put what you have learned in class into practice, and extend what you have learned to create a desktop app that has a persistent state (using a database or serialized objects).
  Due Date: December 6, 2019
### Implementation Requirements
* You will use/adapt the sketching methods discussed in class to your project (see slides from our sketching exercise; you can use a 5+5 method)
* Your project must work with a SQLite database or Java serialization to store and load domain objects from the database
* The state of the system should be stored and loaded from the database/files as appropriate
* Your application must use a MVC design
* Your application should provide at least two different views for some aspect of your model
* Your application should have a splash screen, a menu bar (with appropriate content), a Help menu
* The Help Menu should include a Help Screen, and an About that Displays your team's "company logo" and team members
* Your application must provide a consistent and appropriate look and feel for your project
* Your application should contain at least one custom designed widget that appropriately allows you to enter/display information about some aspect of your domain objects
* Your application should allow interacting and entering model information for at least 5 different types of domain objects
* Domain objects should be able to be created, edited/updated/changed and deleted as appropriate through user or system actions
* Be creative - some points will be reserved for the complexity/creativity of the projects, but do not go too far
### Project Deliverables
* A readme file including the name of all group members and important details on your submission
* A working jar file of a javafx program with source files
* A paper copy of all sketches that were used to plan the applications design, use sticky notes to describe how you used these to guide your final design
* A short one-page report describing your project (a template will be given after the reading week)
* A video demonstration of your app (no longer than 3.5 mins long, if it's shorter that's fine). The video can be narrated, but should demonstrate all the main functionality of your app.
### Assessment
Points will be awarded based on meeting the requirements above, providing a fully working bug/error free system, that follows basic principles of usability.
A small portion of the projects grade will be awarded for creativity/complexity of your project (~10%)
