This is an in-depth explanation of how to use BlockFlow!

BlockFlow is a flowchart design that works by stacking multiple 'Blocks' onto each other. Each Block is represented with a unique color and functionality. Blocks run themselves, then all of the Blocks contained within themselves from top to bottom.

Creating a new Block - Drag a selected block from the menu on the left-hand side into desired target Block. If the target block has multiple blocks contained in it, continue dragging the selected block above or below the nested blocks to specify the order of execution.

Deleting a block - Right-click on the block desired to be deleted and delete it!

#Blocks
This section is dedicated to the explanation of each individual block type. Blocks can be added by dragging them off of the 'Block' menu presented on the left hand side of the window.

Assignment Block - This block is responsible for assigning variables that have been created in the variable creation window with a value.
If Block - This block is responsible for decision making. It is made up of two parts, If and Else. If the comparison is true, the 'If' section will be run. If the comparison is false, the 'Else' section will be run.
For Block - This block is responsible for doing an action multiple times. It has a condition like an If Block and will run itself repeatedly until that condition is false.
